## Thought: The `orders` table does not have a direct column for the order date, but it does have a `created_at` timestamp which I can use to filter the data for March 2025. 
Now, I will update the query to calculate the total sales using the `created_at` column.
## Using tool: query_postgres
## Tool Input: 
"{\"sql\": \"SELECT SUM(bill_total_amount) AS total_sales FROM orders WHERE status='paid' AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = 3 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2025;\"}"
## Tool Output: 
Query returned 1 rows:

Row 1:
  total_sales: None




You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: query_postgres
Tool Arguments: {'sql': {'description': None, 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Executes a SQL query on the connected PostgreSQL database and returns the result.
    
    DATABASE MAPPING:
    - user_transactions database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL_USER_TRANSACTIONS):
      - orders table: Contains order records with bill_total_amount, status, etc.
      - contacts table: Contains customer information
      - order_items table: Contains line items for each order
      
    - plazza_erp database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL_ERP):
      - inventory_transactions table: Contains inventory transactions
      
    - defaultdb database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL):
      - all_products table: Contains product catalog information
    
    The tool will automatically determine which database to use based on the table(s) in your query.
    Make sure to specify the table name clearly in your SQL query.
    
    Examples:
    - To query orders: "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status='paid'"
    - To query inventory: "SELECT * FROM inventory_transactions WHERE vendor_name='Example'"
    - To query products: "SELECT * FROM all_products WHERE name LIKE '%Medicine%'"
    

IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [query_postgres], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action
```

Once all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:

```
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
```

## Thought: The sum of `bill_total_amount` for March 2025 didn't yield results, which indicates there might be no records for that month with a `paid` status or possibly issues with the status categorization.

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: query_postgres
Tool Arguments: {'sql': {'description': None, 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Executes a SQL query on the connected PostgreSQL database and returns the result.
    
    DATABASE MAPPING:
    - user_transactions database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL_USER_TRANSACTIONS):
      - orders table: Contains order records with bill_total_amount, status, etc.
      - contacts table: Contains customer information
      - order_items table: Contains line items for each order
      
    - plazza_erp database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL_ERP):
      - inventory_transactions table: Contains inventory transactions
      
    - defaultdb database (CONNECTION: DATABASE_URL):
      - all_products table: Contains product catalog information
    
    The tool will automatically determine which database to use based on the table(s) in your query.
    Make sure to specify the table name clearly in your SQL query.
    
    Examples:
    - To query orders: "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status='paid'"
    - To query inventory: "SELECT * FROM inventory_transactions WHERE vendor_name='Example'"
    - To query products: "SELECT * FROM all_products WHERE name LIKE '%Medicine%'"
    

IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [query_postgres], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action
```

Once all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:
