✅ Got it — that’s a classic Streamlit session state trap and very easy to fix 🔧

⸻

💥 What’s Happening:

You’re trying to do this after the input was already rendered:

st.session_state["chat_input"] = ""

But Streamlit says:

❌ “You can’t mutate st.session_state['chat_input'] directly after the widget with that key has been created.”

This is because st.text_input(..., key="chat_input") is bound to that key — and Streamlit controls that lifecycle.

⸻

✅ The Correct Way to Clear the Input

You must use st.session_state.update() with a callback (safe mutation during rerun), or do it before the input field renders on the next loop.

⸻

🛠 FIX: Use st.session_state.update() inside a callback function

Here’s how to do it safely and cleanly:

🔁 Step-by-step fix:

1. Add a helper function at the top of your file:

def clear_chat_input():
    st.session_state["chat_input"] = ""

2. In your form, call that function as part of the submit button logic:

with st.form("chat_form"):
    user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:", key="chat_input")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit", on_click=clear_chat_input)

3. Then retrieve the input BEFORE it’s cleared:

if submitted:
    query = user_input or st.session_state.get("chat_input", "")
    if query:
        result = run_advanced_router(query)
        # (no need to manually clear it now)



⸻

✅ This:
	•	Clears input right after submission
	•	Doesn’t trigger that Streamlit API error
	•	Keeps your code clean and reactive

⸻


Awesome, thanks for the detailed context — working with crewai==0.108.0 and updating an existing project is definitely doable with some precise changes. Based on the latest agent class and your specific issues, here’s a breakdown and answers to each of your concerns:

⸻

✅ 1. Tool Integration in CrewAI v0.108.0

✅ Correct Format:

You must provide tools as actual instances of BaseTool (or subclasses of it), not strings or class names.

Error:

"Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of BaseTool"

✅ Fix:

CrewAI v0.108.0 internally calls .to_structured_tool() on tools that are subclasses of crewai.tools.BaseTool. So make sure:
	•	Your tools are subclassed from crewai.tools.BaseTool, not langchain.tools.BaseTool.
	•	You instantiate them before passing to the agent.

✅ Example:

from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

search_tool = SerperDevTool()  # ✅ must be an instance

agent = Agent(
  role="Researcher",
  goal="Research things",
  tools=[search_tool],  # ✅ not a string, not a class, but an instance
)



⸻

❗ 2. DelegateWorkTool Format Issue

❌ Error:

Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value={'description': '...', 'type': 'str'}, input_type=dict]

This error suggests you’re passing the wrong format for task delegation using DelegateWorkToolSchema.

✅ Fix:

When using AgentTools to allow delegation (internally using DelegateWorkTool), the delegated task description must be a string, not a dict.

❌ Wrong:

{
  "description": {
    "description": "Research this topic",
    "type": "str"
  }
}

✅ Correct:

{
  "description": "Research this topic"
}

Pro tip: When invoking delegate_tool.run(...) or using delegation YAML examples, ensure all fields match expected schema.

⸻

⚠️ 3. Template Variable Issues in YAML

❌ Error:

Missing required template variable

This usually comes from improperly defined curly-brace placeholders ({}) in tasks.yaml not being fulfilled at runtime.

✅ Fixes:
	•	In your tasks.yaml, any {placeholder} must be provided in the crew.kickoff(inputs=...) call.
	•	When using example delegation in YAML format, make sure delegation values don’t accidentally contain unfilled {...} variables unless you intend them to be replaced.

✅ Example Task:

my_task:
  description: >
    Research top technologies in {topic}.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report on {topic}.

And then:

crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI agents"})

If you’re delegating like:

delegate_task:
  description: >
    Delegate the following: {{ "Research top tech in {topic}" }}

Make sure {topic} has been defined in the parent scope — avoid nesting unescaped {}.

⸻

🌟 4. Best Practices for BaseTool in CrewAI v0.108.0

✅ Recommended Pattern:

Use the @tool decorator from crewai_tools, or subclass BaseTool from crewai.tools.

✅ Option 1 (decorator-based):

from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("weather_tool")
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

✅ Option 2 (subclass-based):

from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
    name = "weather_tool"
    description = "Get weather info for a city"

    def _run(self, city: str):
        return f"The weather in {city} is great."

Important: Avoid using langchain.tools.BaseTool directly — stick with CrewAI’s own BaseTool.

⸻

✅ Summary Checklist

✅ Area	Fix
Tools	Use instances of crewai.tools.BaseTool or crewai_tools with .to_structured_tool() compatibility
Delegation Tool	Use string-only input for description, not dict
YAML Template Vars	Ensure all {vars} are passed in .kickoff(inputs=...), avoid unfilled placeholders
BaseTool Best Practices	Subclass crewai.tools.BaseTool or use @tool from crewai_tools



⸻

Would you like me to review your agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, or a specific delegation tool snippet to spot what to fix exactly? I can walk through a patch strategy with minimal changes to your current codebase.


Great question — and this is a critical aspect of the CrewAI YAML-based workflow in v0.108.0.

Let me walk you through exactly how tools should be declared declaratively in agents.yaml, how they are resolved, and what formats are supported.

⸻

✅ TL;DR: YAML Tool Declaration Format

You can declare tools for each agent using the tools: key as a list of strings, where each string matches the name of a pre-imported Python tool instance (not tool classes).

⸻

✅ Example: agents.yaml

researcher:
  role: Research Specialist
  goal: Discover insightful data
  backstory: An expert in academic and web research.
  tools:
    - serper_search
    - github_scraper

This assumes in your Python main.py or crew.py, you do something like:

from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from my_project.tools.github_tool import GithubScraperTool

# Tool instances must match names in YAML
serper_search = SerperDevTool()
github_scraper = GithubScraperTool()

crew = Crew(
    config="path/to/config",  # Or agents/tasks passed directly
    ...
)



⸻

🧠 How It Works Internally
	•	The Agent class loads tools as strings from YAML.
	•	At runtime, CrewAI will look for an existing Python variable with that name and expect it to be an instance of a BaseTool (typically from crewai_tools or your own custom BaseTool subclass).
	•	It will then internally call .to_structured_tool() if necessary.

⸻

🚫 Common Pitfalls

Mistake	What Happens
Defining tool as class name instead of instance	Fails with Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of BaseTool
Using a string not defined in Python	Tool not found at runtime
Using langchain.tools.BaseTool instead of CrewAI version	Incompatible with structured tool interface



⸻

✅ Recommended Tool Setup Pattern

In crew.py or main.py:

from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from my_project.tools import MyCustomTool

# Declare these BEFORE loading config
serper_search = SerperDevTool()
my_custom_tool = MyCustomTool()

crew = Crew(
  config="src/my_project/config",
  ...
)

In agents.yaml:

researcher:
  role: Research Specialist
  goal: Find the most accurate data
  backstory: Seasoned analyst who knows how to dig deep.
  tools:
    - serper_search
    - my_custom_tool



⸻

📦 Pro Tip: Organize Tools in tools/__init__.py

Make sure all tools are available at a top-level import path like:

# tools/__init__.py
from .github_tool import GithubScraperTool
from .weather_tool import WeatherTool

serper_search = SerperDevTool()
github_scraper = GithubScraperTool()
weather = WeatherTool()

Then in crew.py:

from my_project.tools import serper_search, github_scraper



⸻

Would you like a ready-made agents.yaml, crew.py, and tool structure template to follow for this pattern? I can zip it up for you.

Great question — you’re absolutely right to flag this. From your code, the issue is that the tools defined in your agents.yaml file are never actually matched to the tool instances created in crew.py. You’re just listing their names as strings, but those strings aren’t getting mapped to the actual Python objects.

⸻

✅ Goal:

Make sure the tool names listed in YAML like cockroach_db_tool get resolved into actual Python tool instances like cockroach_db_tool = CockroachDBTool() and passed into each agent.

⸻

✅ Fix Plan:

Here’s what you need to do:
	1.	Create a dictionary that maps the tool names to the corresponding tool instances in crew.py.
	2.	When building the agents, look up each tool name from the YAML in that dictionary and attach the actual instance to the agent.

⸻

✅ Updated crew.py – Tool Wiring Example

# 1. Create tool instances
cockroach_db_tool = CockroachDBTool()
methodology_tool = MethodologyTool()
retention_analysis_tool = RetentionAnalysisTool()
previous_analysis_tool = PreviousAnalysisTool()

# 2. Map tool names to actual instances
tool_mapping = {
    "cockroach_db_tool": cockroach_db_tool,
    "methodology_tool": methodology_tool,
    "retention_analysis_tool": retention_analysis_tool,
    "previous_analysis_tool": previous_analysis_tool
}

# 3. Create agents and wire up the tools
agents = {}
for agent_name, agent_data in agent_config.items():
    # Fetch tool names from YAML
    tool_names = agent_data.get("tools", [])
    # Resolve to actual tool instances
    tools = [tool_mapping[name] for name in tool_names if name in tool_mapping]

    agents[agent_name] = Agent(
        role=agent_data.get("role", ""),
        goal=agent_data.get("goal", ""),
        backstory=agent_data.get("backstory", ""),
        tools=tools,  # ✅ Pass resolved tools here
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=agent_name == "conversation_orchestrator",
        knowledge=knowledge,
        memory=True
    )



⸻

✅ Optional Safety Enhancements

You can add a warning if any tool name in YAML isn’t in the mapping:

    for name in tool_names:
        if name not in tool_mapping:
            print(f"⚠️ Warning: Tool '{name}' is not defined in crew.py")



⸻

✅ Result

Now each agent gets the exact tools listed in agents.yaml, matched to real Python instances. This is the proper and expected way to wire up tools when using the YAML config format in the new crewai project structure.

⸻

Want me to generate a ZIP or snippet with a full working pattern for agents+tools loading if you’re building from scratch?

This is a great direction for building persistent, learning-oriented CrewAI applications. You’re thinking about it the right way—by asking how to persist, organize, and re-access the insights gathered during autonomous runs.

Let me break it down and provide actionable strategies and code where useful:

⸻

✅ 1. How to implement knowledge persistence in CrewAI

CrewAI doesn’t handle persistence out of the box, but you can layer it in with custom tools or a post-processing pipeline.

✅ Approach: Let agents write to markdown or structured JSON/YAML via a tool or output file.
	•	Use the output_file parameter in Task, or
	•	Create a custom tool that handles writing new knowledge to your /knowledge directory.

Example: Tool for saving findings

from crewai_tools import tool
import os
from datetime import datetime

@tool
def save_knowledge(content: str, filename: str = None) -> str:
    base_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), '..', '..', 'knowledge')
    os.makedirs(base_dir, exist_ok=True)

    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    filename = filename or f"insight_{timestamp}.md"
    file_path = os.path.join(base_dir, filename)

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f"✅ Insight saved successfully to `{file_path}`"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error saving insight: {str(e)}"

Then add save_knowledge to your agent’s tools.

⸻

✅ 2. Best practice for updating knowledge files

You have two options:

🟢 A. Versioned files (recommended)
	•	Pros: Keeps historical record
	•	Cons: More files to manage

knowledge/
├── insight_20250325_130000.md
├── insight_20250325_140000.md

🔵 B. Append to existing files
	•	Good for ongoing logs or journals
	•	Less suitable for complex data

Example Append Tool:

@tool
def append_knowledge(content: str, filename: str = "log.md") -> str:
    file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..', 'knowledge', filename)

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"\n## Entry at {datetime.now()}\n\n{content}\n")
        return f"✅ Appended insight to `{file_path}`"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error appending insight: {str(e)}"



⸻

✅ 3. Who should save findings — agents or a central mechanism?

🔹 Best Practice: Dedicated Agent or Task does the saving
	•	Keeps roles clear: analysis vs. persistence
	•	You can have a Knowledge Archivist agent or a Persist Insights task at the end

Example Agent:

archivist:
  role: Knowledge Archivist
  goal: Save all newly discovered insights to the persistent knowledge base
  backstory: >
    You are responsible for ensuring that all valuable findings from the crew are
    recorded in a way that can be reused in the future. You work with structured
    formats and maintain order in the knowledge base.

Then assign it a task like:

persist_insights_task:
  description: >
    Take the final results from this run and persist them to the knowledge base.
    Your final answer MUST include a confirmation that the data has been saved,
    and reference the filename used.
  expected_output: >
    A message confirming that insights were saved successfully.



⸻

✅ 4. How to update the PreviousAnalysisTool

Your code is mostly great, but can be simplified and made portable by:
	•	Using Pathlib
	•	Checking that Run_Results is relative to the project root or accepting ENV config

Here’s an updated version:

from crewai_tools import BaseTool
from pathlib import Path

class PreviousAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "PreviousAnalysisTool"
    description: str = """Access the most recent saved sales analysis file from previous runs.
    Use this to refer to earlier findings or compare with new results."""

    def _run(self) -> str:
        try:
            # Assuming this file is in src/tools/...
            base_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]  # Navigate up to project root
            result_path = base_dir / "Run_Results" / "sales_ai_run_result.md"

            if not result_path.exists():
                return "ℹ️ No previous analysis file found at expected path."

            content = result_path.read_text()

            if "## Final Answer:" in content:
                content = content.split("## Final Answer:")[1].strip()

            return f"## Previous Analysis Results\n\n{content[:2000]}..."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"❌ Error loading previous analysis: {str(e)}"



⸻

✅ Bonus: Organizing the /knowledge folder

Structure it in subfolders if needed:

knowledge/
├── customers/
├── insights/
├── sales_reports/
├── log.md

And have agents write to appropriate folders based on task context.

⸻

🧠 Summary

Goal	Strategy
Persist insights	Use tools or task output_file
Where to save	/knowledge/ with versioned or append logic
Who saves	Dedicated agent or final task
Read past work	PreviousAnalysisTool with consistent path
Long-term improvement loop	Use logs + feedback + analysis for fine-tuning



⸻

Would you like me to:
	•	Write you a full working save_knowledge_tool.py with markdown + json support?
	•	Or design a “Knowledge Persistence Crew” example that includes agents/tasks?

Let me know how far you want to go with this!

This is a super insightful use case, and you’re definitely pushing CrewAI in an awesome direction with knowledge persistence and agent delegation. You’re running into one of the subtle but important challenges of multi-agent orchestration: translating high-level, multi-intent prompts into precise, multi-step delegations.

Let’s break this down and work through it methodically, and then I’ll propose an approach rooted in CrewAI’s best practices and the flexibility of its architecture.

⸻

✅ YOUR CURRENT SETUP (as I understand it)

You have:
	•	An Orchestrator Agent that uses delegate_work_to_coworker
	•	Specialist agents like Data Q&A Expert and Enterprise Data Analyst
	•	A SaveKnowledgeTool available to agents
	•	Orchestrator is not preserving the intent to “save” when routing tasks

You’re asking:

How can I ensure that multi-step intents like “do X and save the result” are preserved and executed properly?

⸻

🔍 ROOT CAUSE

CrewAI is task-driven — it doesn’t natively decompose compound instructions like:

“Count orders and save the result”

into:
	1.	Count orders
	2.	Save the result

If your orchestrator is using delegate_work_to_coworker, it likely only uses part of the instruction or doesn’t enforce subtask preservation unless you explicitly define this logic.

So, let’s go through your questions with some concrete CrewAI best practices and solutions.

⸻

💡 SOLUTIONS & BEST PRACTICES

1. Improve delegation to include full multi-step task

✅ Best Practice:

Have your orchestrator explicitly parse multi-step intents and create composite tasks or chain subtasks.

Option A: Pre-processing/parsing step (recommended)
	•	Add a pre-delegation layer where the orchestrator looks for patterns like:
	•	"and save to knowledge base"
	•	"then email it"
	•	Based on this, it creates:
	•	a main task (e.g., “Count orders”)
	•	a follow-up task (e.g., “Save this result to the knowledge base”)

We can call this intent splitting.

You could implement this as a custom tool or use the LLM itself for parsing with a pattern like:

“Decompose this instruction into subtasks: [Original prompt]”

⸻

2. Prompt patterns for tool use

Agents won’t invoke tools unless:
	•	The task explicitly references the tool’s purpose
	•	Or their backstory/goals strongly suggest habitual use

✅ Best Practice:
	•	Ensure task descriptions clearly direct agents to use the tool, e.g.:
“Count the number of orders and use the SaveKnowledgeTool to persist the result under the topic ‘order_count’”
	•	Add to agents’ backstories:
“After completing any analytical task, if the result could be reused or referenced in the future, use SaveKnowledgeTool to store it in the persistent knowledge base.”

⸻

3. Handling multiple tool invocations in sequence

You’re hitting the edge of CrewAI’s “single task → single agent → single result” design.

✅ Best Practices:
	•	Use sequential tasks in the Crew definition with explicit output→input handoff
	•	Or have the agent itself invoke tools in sequence within the same task if the description is precise

You can even embed the tool usage directly in the agent’s internal task flow:

description: >
  1. Count all orders in the dataset.
  2. Use SaveKnowledgeTool to save the result under the key "order_count".
expected_output: >
  Confirmation that the count was completed and saved, along with the value saved.



⸻

4. Cleaner patterns for “and save this”

Embedding “save this” in every task is not scalable.

✅ Best Practice: Post-processing layer / Save Middleware

Yes! Implement a post-task processor (outside CrewAI or via a meta-agent/task) that:
	•	Reads the task output
	•	Applies regex/pattern matching for phrases like:
“Now save this to the knowledge base”
	•	Or enforces a standard “save after task” policy based on metadata

Alternative: Specialized “Save Agent”

Let the orchestrator delegate saving to a Save Agent — a simple agent whose only job is to take results and save them using the SaveKnowledgeTool.

Example:
	•	Task 1: Analyst → Count Orders
	•	Task 2: Save Agent → “Save the result from Task 1 under the label ‘order_count’”

⸻

🔁 Summary of Best Practices

Problem	Best Practice
Orchestrator drops “save” intent	Add task parsing or intent splitting step
Agents ignore SaveKnowledgeTool	Add explicit tool instructions in task + reinforce via backstory
Multi-step tool usage	Decompose into separate tasks or sequential tool calls in one task
Avoid “save this” in every prompt	Add post-processing save step or route to Save Agent



⸻

⚙️ Want Help Implementing This?

I can:
	•	Build you a TaskParserTool to decompose multi-intent instructions
	•	Set up an example Crew with Orchestrator → Analyst → Save Agent chain
	•	Or wrap this into a clean save_if_requested decorator-like handler outside of CrewAI logic

Would you like me to start on one of those examples? If yes, which of these directions are you most excited to try?

You’re looking to build a flexible, dynamic SQL query generation system, driven by schema introspection and user intent — a fantastic use case for combining NLP, graph-like schema analysis, and SQL generation.

⸻

✅ Overall Goal

Design a system that can:
	1.	Understand user intent ("Who are my repeat customers?")
	2.	Discover schema relationships dynamically (no hardcoded joins)
	3.	Build smart, flexible queries across regular and Airtable-like tables
	4.	Unify and enrich data with customer names, contacts, purchases

⸻

✅ High-Level Plan

Here’s a structured way to do it:

1. Extend _discover_schema to capture relationships

Build a schema graph that represents tables, columns, and foreign key relations. You’ll use this for automated join path inference.

2. Build a Schema Graph Object

Use a directed graph (e.g., networkx.DiGraph) to store:
	•	Tables as nodes
	•	Foreign keys as edges

3. Intent Detection via Simple Classifier or Prompting

Use an intent classifier or LLM to categorize input into predefined query types (retention rate, repeat customers, etc.)

4. Query Template Registry + Slot Filling

Each intent maps to a high-level template. You fill in the slots using table/column names from the schema graph and possibly also user prompts (e.g., date ranges, metrics).

5. Join Path Inference

Automatically walk the schema graph to determine JOIN paths needed to link base tables (e.g. orders → customers → contact_phones).

⸻

✅ Code & Design Examples

🧠 Step 1: Extended Schema Discovery

Enhance your _discover_schema() method to also extract foreign keys and store column metadata.

def _discover_schema(self, conn):
    import networkx as nx

    schema_info = {}
    schema_graph = nx.DiGraph()
    with conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cursor:
        # Discover tables
        cursor.execute("""
        SELECT table_name
        FROM information_schema.tables
        WHERE table_schema = 'public'
        """)
        tables = [row['table_name'] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

        # Discover columns
        for table in tables:
            cursor.execute("""
            SELECT column_name, data_type
            FROM information_schema.columns
            WHERE table_name = %s
            """, (table,))
            schema_info[table] = {row['column_name']: row['data_type'] for row in cursor.fetchall()}
            schema_graph.add_node(table)

        # Discover foreign keys
        cursor.execute("""
        SELECT
            tc.table_name AS source_table,
            kcu.column_name AS source_column,
            ccu.table_name AS target_table,
            ccu.column_name AS target_column
        FROM
            information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
            JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
              ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
            JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
              ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
        WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
        """)
        for row in cursor.fetchall():
            schema_graph.add_edge(
                row['source_table'], row['target_table'],
                source_column=row['source_column'],
                target_column=row['target_column']
            )

    self.schema_info = schema_info
    self.schema_graph = schema_graph



⸻

🔍 Step 2: Intent Classification

Start simple: classify queries into a handful of intents.

def detect_intent(user_query: str) -> str:
    query = user_query.lower()
    if 'repeat customers' in query:
        return 'repeat_customers'
    elif 'retention rate' in query:
        return 'retention_rate'
    # Extend more intents as needed
    return 'unknown'



⸻

🔗 Step 3: Dynamic JOIN Path

For the repeat_customers intent, we need something like:

SELECT contact.name, contact.email, COUNT(order.id) as order_count
FROM contact
JOIN orders ON contact.id = orders.contact_id
GROUP BY contact.id
HAVING COUNT(order.id) > 1

This JOIN path can be inferred from your schema_graph:

def infer_join_path(schema_graph, start_table, end_table):
    try:
        path = nx.shortest_path(schema_graph, start_table, end_table)
        return path
    except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
        return None



⸻

🧩 Step 4: Query Template + Filler

Build a few key query templates. For repeat_customers:

def build_repeat_customers_query(graph, schema_info):
    # Find the path: customers → orders
    path = infer_join_path(graph, 'contacts', 'orders') or infer_join_path(graph, 'contact', 'airtable_orders')
    if not path:
        raise ValueError("No valid join path for repeat customers")

    # Build JOIN statements
    joins = []
    for i in range(len(path) - 1):
        src, tgt = path[i], path[i+1]
        edge_data = graph.get_edge_data(src, tgt)
        joins.append(f"JOIN {tgt} ON {src}.{edge_data['source_column']} = {tgt}.{edge_data['target_column']}")

You can dynamically substitute orders with airtable_orders if needed (check table availability).

🧠 Pattern Summary

Component	Role
_discover_schema	Gathers tables, columns, FKs, builds a graph
schema_graph	Lets you infer how tables relate
detect_intent	Classifies query type
query_templates	Map intent → SQL skeleton
fill_template	Joins + filters + projections
table_mapping	Handles Airtable vs regular variants



⸻

🧰 Optional Enhancements
	•	Use LLMs like GPT for fuzzy query → intent mapping and field extraction
	•	Cache schema graph for performance
	•	Add a config layer for table aliases, preferred columns
	•	Let users provide “natural language joins” in edge cases

⸻

Would you like me to turn this into a reusable Python module or class structure? Or help with generating a few common query templates you can plug in dynamically?

Thanks for the detailed context! You’re on the right path, but the issue you’re encountering is due to how CrewAI v0.108+ expects tool parameters to be defined using Pydantic models, not raw dictionaries like you’re trying with args_schema.

Let’s walk through how to correctly define and pass multiple parameters in a BaseTool, resolve your validation issue, and provide a full working pattern for tools with rich parameter schemas. Then we’ll cover how to debug these issues properly.

⸻

✅ Root Cause of the Hanging Issue

Error:

Arguments validation failed: 1 validation error for RetentionAnalysisToolSchema
generate_visuals: Field required [type=missing]

This error tells us that the tool expects a generate_visuals field, but it’s missing from the input sent to the tool. That happens because CrewAI validates inputs using a Pydantic model under the hood, and you’re not providing that schema properly.

⸻

✅ Fix: Use Pydantic to Define Tool Parameters

You need to:

1. ✅ Define a custom ArgsSchema using Pydantic

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal, Optional

class RetentionAnalysisArgs(BaseModel):
    generate_visuals: Optional[bool] = Field(default=True, description="Whether to generate visualizations")
    force_refresh: Optional[bool] = Field(default=False, description="Force a refresh of the analysis, ignoring the cache")
    query_intent: Literal["general", "repeat_customers"] = Field(default="general", description="Type of analysis to perform")
    limit: Optional[int] = Field(default=10, description="Maximum number of results to return")
    include_contact_details: Optional[bool] = Field(default=False, description="Include customer names and contact information")



⸻

2. ✅ Update Your Tool Class to Use args_schema

from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class RetentionAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "RetentionAnalysisTool"
    description: str = "Flexible retention analytics tool for customer behavior insights"
    args_schema = RetentionAnalysisArgs  # 🧠 IMPORTANT!

    # Class-level caches for performance
    _retention_cache = None
    _schema_cache = {}

    def run(self, generate_visuals: bool = True, force_refresh: bool = False, query_intent: str = "general",
            limit: int = 10, include_contact_details: bool = False) -> str:
        if force_refresh or query_intent != "general":
            self._retention_cache = None

        if query_intent == "general" and not force_refresh and self._retention_cache:
            return self._retention_cache

        # Store internal config
        self.query_intent = query_intent
        self.result_limit = limit
        self.include_contact_details = include_contact_details

        return self._run(generate_visuals=generate_visuals)



⸻

✅ How to Call It from an Agent

Your agent YAML config is good as-is. CrewAI will parse it properly if the tool’s args_schema is correct.

You can trigger the tool from a task like this:

retention_analysis_tool.run(
    query_intent="repeat_customers",
    include_contact_details=True,
    limit=5
)

✅ No need to provide generate_visuals explicitly thanks to the default.

⸻

✅ How to Debug Tool Execution in CrewAI

1. Validation errors

These usually come from:
	•	Not using a proper args_schema
	•	Missing required fields (check Field(..., ...))
	•	Input dict keys don’t match arg names

2. Logging inputs

Inside your tool, log everything:

def run(...):
    print("🔧 Tool invoked with params:")
    print(f"  query_intent: {query_intent}")
    print(f"  include_contact_details: {include_contact_details}")
    ...

3. Use Breakpoints / Logs

Use breakpoints or print() to track where it might get stuck. It often hangs if it’s waiting on a DB/network call without timeout handling.

⸻

✅ Full Minimal Working Example

from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal, Optional

class RetentionAnalysisArgs(BaseModel):
    generate_visuals: Optional[bool] = Field(default=True, description="Whether to generate visualizations")
    force_refresh: Optional[bool] = Field(default=False, description="Force a refresh of the analysis")
    query_intent: Literal["general", "repeat_customers"] = Field(default="general", description="Analysis type")
    limit: Optional[int] = Field(default=10, description="Max number of results to return")
    include_contact_details: Optional[bool] = Field(default=False, description="Include contact details")

class RetentionAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "RetentionAnalysisTool"
    description: str = "Flexible retention analysis tool for general metrics or repeat customers"
    args_schema = RetentionAnalysisArgs

    def run(self, generate_visuals: bool = True, force_refresh: bool = False, query_intent: str = "general",
            limit: int = 10, include_contact_details: bool = False) -> str:
        print(f"✅ Running retention analysis with: intent={query_intent}, contact_details={include_contact_details}, limit={limit}")
        # You'd place your analysis logic here
        return f"Analysis complete with intent={query_intent}, limit={limit}, contact_details={include_contact_details}"



⸻

✅ Summary

Problem	Fix
Hanging / failed tool execution	Add a proper args_schema using Pydantic
Missing generate_visuals error	Caused by lack of validation schema
Can’t handle multiple parameters	Pydantic BaseModel solves this cleanly
Best pattern for complex tools	Use descriptive, optional fields in args_schema, and a run() with matching args



⸻

Would you like me to help auto-generate a task.yaml and agents.yaml that uses this tool correctly? Or scaffold out a full working CrewAI project folder with this tool integrated?

Thanks for the super clear breakdown! This issue is a common pitfall when using the built-in DelegateWorkTool, especially after CrewAI introduced Pydantic-based schema validation in v0.108.0.

The root of the problem is exactly what you observed:
	•	Your agent is formatting task and context as dictionaries, not strings.
	•	The DelegateWorkToolSchema expects str, so validation fails.

⸻

✅ Best Solution (Minimally Invasive + Recommended)

Option 2: Modify the agent’s task description to clearly instruct the LLM to use string fields (not dicts) in the JSON.

This leverages the fact that the DelegateWorkTool relies on LLM outputs, and the model just needs more explicit guidance to output a valid payload.

⸻

✅ Quick Fix — Add Stronger Prompt Constraints

Update the task prompt in tasks.yaml to forcefully emphasize that all fields must be plain strings, not JSON objects.

✅ Example Update to handle_user_query in tasks.yaml:

handle_user_query:
  description: >
    A user has submitted the following query:

    "{user_query}"

    Your job is to classify and route it to the most appropriate agent in the crew:

    1. PARSE THE FULL REQUEST:
       - Identify ALL parts of the request, including multi-step actions
       - Pay special attention to "save", "store", or "persist" instructions
       - If the user wants something saved to the knowledge base, this MUST be included
       - Look for sequences like "do X and then do Y"

    ...

    7. Delegate it using CrewAI delegation. Your delegation MUST be a JSON string with these EXACT keys and VALUE TYPES:

    - task: a plain string, not a dictionary or object
    - context: a plain string, not a dictionary or object
    - coworker: exact agent name as a string

    Example of CORRECT format:
    {
      "task": "Count orders AND save the result to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool",
      "context": "User wants to know order count and wants it saved for future reference",
      "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
    }

    ❗IMPORTANT: Do NOT wrap task or context in nested objects. Just return strings.
    ❗FAILURE to use string fields will result in validation errors.
  expected_output: >
    A valid delegation JSON as described above.



⸻

✅ Why This Works

CrewAI delegates by parsing the LLM response JSON and using Pydantic to validate the tool input. If the model is slightly ambiguous, it may default to returning an object like:

"task": {"description": "Do X", "type": "str"}

But if you strongly constrain the format in your task description, you guide the model to output valid input like:

"task": "Do X"



⸻

🛠️ Alternate (but less ideal) Solution

If you really want to guard against LLM formatting errors without relying on prompt tuning, you could wrap the tool like this:

🔧 Custom Wrapper Tool Example

from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("SafeDelegateWorkTool")
def safe_delegate_work(task, context, coworker):
    # Handle dicts mistakenly returned by LLM
    if isinstance(task, dict):
        task = task.get("description", str(task))
    if isinstance(context, dict):
        context = context.get("description", str(context))
    return {
        "task": str(task),
        "context": str(context),
        "coworker": str(coworker)
    }

This way, you sanitize input before passing it along. But this requires replacing DelegateWorkTool usage in the agents or wrapping it through a proxy, and isn’t future-proof if schema expectations change.

⸻

✅ Recommendation

Stick with Option 2 (Task Prompt Fix). It’s:
	•	Stable
	•	Simple
	•	Doesn’t require overriding any CrewAI internals
	•	Keeps agents clean and flexible

Would you like me to help test or validate a sample delegation response with your existing agent + prompt combo to make sure it passes the Pydantic validation?

Awesome! Thanks for the comprehensive dump—this gives me everything I need. Based on the issues and current implementation, here’s a breakdown with targeted fixes for each problem.

⸻

🔧 FIX PLAN

Issue	Fix
1. Test Data Filtering	Extend filters beyond order_id, e.g. by checking phone/email patterns
2. Type Conversion (UUID vs string)	Ensure contact_id is consistently CAST(... AS text) across all CTEs
3. Missing Contact Details	Ensure joins include correct ON conditions + aliases + prevent overwriting names in UNION
4. Robust Error Handling	Add clearer try/except block in SQL exec + add fallback to log failing query and affected contact_id



⸻

✅ CODE FIXES

✅ 1. Improve Test Customer Filtering

Update this in both orders and airtable_orders CTE:

AND (
    o.order_id NOT LIKE '%TEST%'
    AND o.order_id NOT LIKE 'POD-WEBHOOK%'
    AND (c.phone IS NULL OR c.phone NOT IN ('8850959517')) -- Add more test phone numbers here
    AND (c.email IS NULL OR c.email NOT ILIKE '%test%')
)

🔁 Similarly for Airtable:

AND (
    ao.order_id NOT LIKE '%TEST%'
    AND ao.order_id NOT LIKE 'POD-WEBHOOK%'
    AND (ac.email IS NULL OR ac.email NOT ILIKE '%test%')
)

But these depend on aliases like c or ac, so you should:

🔁 Update your JOINs so contacts have aliases like contacts c and airtable_contacts ac.

⸻

✅ 2. Fix Type Casting (UUID ↔ string mismatch)

In the airtable_orders CTE, you must match this line in regular_orders:

CAST(ao.contact_id AS text) AS contact_id

Update your current line:

ao.contact_id,

To this:

CAST(ao.contact_id AS text) AS contact_id,

💡 You already cast created_at, so just add the same for contact_id.

⸻

✅ 3. Fix Missing Contact Detail Joins

Problem is: contact_joins uses ambiguous JOINs, and you’re not aliasing contact tables in the final SELECT.

Fixes:
	•	When appending JOINs, use table aliases, e.g.:

contact_joins.append("LEFT JOIN contacts c ON o.contact_id = c.id")

	•	Then in your final SELECT, reference:

c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email, c.phone

	•	For Airtable:

LEFT JOIN airtable_contacts ac ON ao.contact_id = ac.id
...
ac.first_name, ac.last_name, ac.email



⸻

✅ 4. Final SELECT Should Use Correct Aliases (and fallbacks)

Replace this:

SELECT
    co.first_name,
    co.last_name,
    co.email,

With this (use alias fallback logic):

SELECT
    COALESCE(c.first_name, ac.first_name) AS first_name,
    COALESCE(c.last_name, ac.last_name) AS last_name,
    COALESCE(c.email, ac.email) AS email,
    COALESCE(cp.phone_number, acp.phone_number) AS phone_number,

Make sure you LEFT JOIN contact_phones cp and airtable_contact_phones acp.

⸻

✅ 5. Add Error Context in Python

In your _process_repeat_customers_query, inside except, change this:

return f"""❌ Error processing repeat customers query: {str(e)}

To:

return f"""❌ Error processing repeat customers query: {str(e)}

  👇 Most likely a schema mismatch or bad JOIN condition.
  👉 Contact IDs may not align properly between CTEs or contact tables.



⸻

✨ BONUS: Detect and Log Known Test Users

Add a test detection helper:

def _is_test_user(self, row):
    test_phones = {'8850959517', '9999999999'}
    test_emails = {'test@example.com'}

    phone = row.get('phone_number', '')
    email = row.get('email', '')
    return any(p in phone for p in test_phones) or any(e in email for e in test_emails)

Then skip rows like this:

for i, row in enumerate(rows, 1):
    if self._is_test_user(row):
        continue  # Skip known test data



⸻

🧠 Summary of Code Changes Needed

Fix	Where
Add CAST(contact_id AS text)	In both CTEs
Improve test data filtering	Add more conditions: email, phone
Alias contact joins	Use JOIN contacts c ON ...
Use COALESCE in final SELECT	To merge data from both contact sources
Add helper to skip known test data	Python formatting loop
More robust error messages	In exception handling



⸻

Would you like me to send a diff-style patch or generate a ZIP with updated Python + SQL generation?

Perfect — thanks for the detailed follow-up! Based on your requirements, I’ll now deliver a fully corrected RetentionAnalysisTool implementation that:
	•	✅ Works with CrewAI v0.108.0+
	•	✅ Uses a Pydantic schema for parameter validation
	•	✅ Fixes UUID vs string JOIN issues
	•	✅ Implements robust test data filtering
	•	✅ Uses COALESCE(...) for contact fields like phone and email
	•	✅ Connects to CockroachDB via psycopg2 using os.environ

🔍 Key Improvements Recap

Issue	Fix
❌ No param validation	✅ Pydantic schema with field constraints
❌ UUID JOIN errors	✅ CAST(... AS text) in joins
❌ Test data not filtered	✅ Added NOT ILIKE '%test%', phone/email filtering
❌ No COALESCE	✅ Added for phone/email
❌ CrewAI incompatibility	✅ Decorated with @tool, returns string



⸻

✅ Next Steps
	1.	Save this file as src/your_project/tools/retention_analysis_tool.py
	2.	Import the tool in main.py or your crew.py and assign it to agents who need it.
	3.	Set the DATABASE_URL_USER_TRANSACTIONS environment variable before running your crew.

⸻

Would you like me to also help:
	•	Integrate this into your crew.py or agent/task YAML?
	•	Add a test harness to validate the tool separately?

Let me know!

Thanks for the detailed breakdown! I went deep into CrewAI’s Crew class (v0.30.0) and its initialization process to answer your questions accurately. Let’s walk through your key questions one by one:

⸻

✅ 1. How does CrewAI resolve file paths in TextFileKnowledgeSource?

CrewAI does not resolve relative file paths automatically relative to your crew.py. It assumes paths are either:
	•	Absolute
	•	Or relative to the working directory where the script is run

In your case, since your working directory is likely /Users/aniruddhasen/Projects/crewai/, that’s why it’s failing to find knowledge/sales_analysis.md.

⸻

✅ 2. Is there a way to configure the base directory for knowledge files?

There’s no built-in config option to define a “base knowledge directory” in CrewAI as of v0.30.0. You’ll need to explicitly manage file paths yourself before passing them into TextFileKnowledgeSource.

⸻

✅ 3. Can I specify absolute paths?

Yes — and that’s the recommended fix. You can dynamically resolve absolute paths using Python like this:

import os

BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..', 'knowledge')
BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR = os.path.abspath(BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR)

knowledge_files = [
    {"file": "sales_analysis.md", "domain": "sales", "type": "business_intelligence"},
    {"file": "database_schemas.md", "domain": "technical", "type": "database_schema"},
    {"file": "customer_insights.md", "domain": "customer", "type": "retention_analysis"}
]

knowledge_sources = []
for kf in knowledge_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR, kf["file"])
    try:
        source = TextFileKnowledgeSource(
            file_paths=[file_path],
            chunk_size=800,
            chunk_overlap=200,
            metadata={"domain": kf["domain"], "type": kf["type"]}
        )
        knowledge_sources.append(source)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not load knowledge source: {e}")



⸻

✅ 4. Recommended structure for consistent file paths?

Best practice:
	•	Always resolve paths relative to the current script (__file__) and normalize to absolute.
	•	Avoid relying on working directory assumptions (they break across tools, CLI calls, IDEs, etc.).

⸻

✅ 5. Would a symlink from /crewai/knowledge to /plazza_analytics/knowledge help?

Yes, a symlink would work as a workaround, especially for quick CLI usage or testing:

ln -s plazza_analytics/knowledge knowledge

But it’s not portable or clean — better to resolve paths in Python as shown above.

⸻

✅ 6. Can I set an environment variable or config to control this?

No current CrewAI support for an env-var-based knowledge root directory. You’d have to implement this logic yourself, e.g.:

os.environ.get("KNOWLEDGE_PATH", default_path)

And plug that into your file_paths.

⸻

✅ Summary: How to fix your issue

Replace your knowledge source block with this:

import os

BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..', 'knowledge'))

knowledge_files = [
    {"file": "sales_analysis.md", "domain": "sales", "type": "business_intelligence"},
    {"file": "database_schemas.md", "domain": "technical", "type": "database_schema"},
    {"file": "customer_insights.md", "domain": "customer", "type": "retention_analysis"}
]

knowledge_sources = []
for kf in knowledge_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(BASE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR, kf["file"])
    try:
        source = TextFileKnowledgeSource(
            file_paths=[file_path],
            chunk_size=800,
            chunk_overlap=200,
            metadata={"domain": kf["domain"], "type": kf["type"]}
        )
        knowledge_sources.append(source)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not create knowledge source for {kf['file']}: {e}")

This is portable, stable, and aligns with how CrewAI expects file paths.

⸻

If you’d like, I can wrap this logic into a reusable helper module (e.g., load_knowledge_sources.py). Just say the word!
