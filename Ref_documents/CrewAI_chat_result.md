🤖 Starting Plazza Analytics Crew...

 [DEBUG]: == Working Agent: Conversation Orchestrator

 [INFO]: == Starting Task: A user has submitted the following query:
"how many unique customers do I have?"
Your job is to classify and route it to the most appropriate agent in the crew:
1. PARSE THE FULL REQUEST:
   - Identify ALL parts of the request, including multi-step actions
   - Pay special attention to "save", "store", or "persist" instructions
   - If the user wants something saved to the knowledge base, this MUST be included
   - Look for sequences like "do X and then do Y"

2. Classify the primary task type:
   - Quick Q&A from KB or DB
   - Full business analysis
   - Visualization/chart generation
   - Strategic business recommendation
   - Customer retention analysis (NEW)
   - Repeat customer identification (NEW)

3. Choose the best specialist agent:
   - Data Q&A Expert: for simple metrics, customer lists, and fast DB/KB lookups
   - Enterprise Data Analyst: for deep analysis or fresh data needs
   - Data Visualization Expert: for charts, dashboards, visuals
   - Strategic Business Consultant: for strategy/growth decisions

4. RETENTION ANALYSIS DETECTION:
   - For queries about "repeat customers", "loyal customers", "retention", etc. → Data Q&A Expert
   - For queries requesting customer names, contact details, purchase history → Data Q&A Expert
   - These should include in the task to use the enhanced RetentionAnalysisTool

5. Construct a COMPLETE task description:
   - Include ALL parts of the user's request without omitting steps
   - If the request includes saving data, explicitly mention "save the result using SaveKnowledgeTool"
   - For example, "Count orders AND save the result to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool"
   - Never drop or omit parts of multi-step requests
   - For retention/repeat customer requests: include instructions to use RetentionAnalysisTool with appropriate parameters

6. ENHANCED RETENTION TOOL INSTRUCTIONS:
   - For queries about "who are my repeat customers" → Include "Use RetentionAnalysisTool with query_intent='repeat_customers'"
   - For requests with "show contact details/names" → Add "include_contact_details=True" parameter
   - For requests with specific counts like "top 5" → Add "limit=5" parameter

7. Delegate it using CrewAI delegation. Your delegation MUST be a JSON object with these EXACT keys and VALUE TYPES:
{
  "task": "string with instructions (NOT a dictionary or object)",
  "context": "string with background (NOT a dictionary or object)",
  "coworker": "exact agent name as string"
}
❗IMPORTANT: The "task" and "context" fields MUST be simple strings, NOT nested objects or dictionaries. ❗All three fields are REQUIRED or the delegation will fail with validation errors.
Example of CORRECT JSON format for multi-step delegations: {
  "task": "Count orders AND save the result to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool",
  "context": "User wants to know order count and wants it saved for future reference",
  "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
}
Example for retention analysis: {
  "task": "Identify repeat customers using RetentionAnalysisTool with query_intent='repeat_customers', include_contact_details=True",
  "context": "User wants to see a list of repeat customers with their contact information",
  "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
}
❌ INCORRECT format (DO NOT USE): {
  "task": {"instruction": "Count orders", "save": true},
  "context": {"background": "User needs order count", "priority": "high"},
  "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
}
8. Simply return the exact response from the delegated agent.
Your final answer MUST be the exact response from the delegated agent without any modifications.

The user wants to find out the number of unique customers they have. This is a simple data lookup task that requires counting unique entries in a customer database. The most appropriate expert for this task would be the Data Q&A Expert.

Action: Delegate work to co-worker
Action Input: 
{
  "task": "Count the number of unique customers",
  "context": "The user wants to know how many unique customers they have",
  "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
} 


> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
To count the number of unique customers, I need to query both the regular and airtable_* tables, specifically the contacts and airtable_contacts tables. I should use the CockroachDBTool for this, running a SQL query to count the distinct customers in each table, and then add the two counts together.

Action: CockroachDBTool
Action Input: {"query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM contacts UNION ALL SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM airtable_contacts;", "database": "user_transactions"} 

{'count': 191}
{'count': 4713}

Thought: 
I have the counts from both the regular and airtable contacts tables. I need to add these two counts together to get the total number of unique customers.

Final Answer: The total number of unique customers is 4904 (191 from the regular table and 4713 from the airtable).

 [DEBUG]: == Working Agent: Conversation Orchestrator

 [INFO]: == Starting Task: The user has requested information about repeat customers:
"how many unique customers do I have?"
Identify and analyze repeat customers across both regular and Airtable data sources. Use the enhanced RetentionAnalysisTool with appropriate parameters based on the query:
1. DETERMINE THE RIGHT PARAMETERS:
   - For general repeat customer metrics → query_intent="general"
   - For specific customer names and details → query_intent="repeat_customers"
   - If contact information is needed → include_contact_details=True
   - If a specific number of results is requested → limit=X (where X is the desired number)

2. SPECIFIC PARAMETER COMBINATIONS:
   - "Who are my repeat customers?" → query_intent="repeat_customers"
   - "Show me details about my repeat customers" → query_intent="repeat_customers", include_contact_details=True
   - "Who are my top 5 repeat customers?" → query_intent="repeat_customers", limit=5
   - "What's my overall retention rate?" → query_intent="general"

3. GENERATE A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
   - Include both metrics and specific customer details as appropriate
   - Format monetary values in Indian Rupees (₹)
   - Ensure data from both regular and Airtable sources is included
   - Focus on the most valuable insights for business decision-making

4. If valuable new insights are found, save them to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool.

## Data Volume Report
- Regular orders table: 28 paid orders
- Airtable orders table: 0 paid orders
- Total orders across all sources: 28
- Regular orders represent: 100.0% of total
- Airtable orders represent: 0.0% of total

⚠️ *Including both data sources is critical for accurate analysis*

## Sales Summary
- Regular orders total: ₹6,564.10
- Airtable orders total: ₹0.00
- Combined total sales: ₹6,564.10

## Retention Summary
- Total customers: 2
- Repeat customers: 2
- One-time customers: 0
- Repeat rate: 100.0%

## Time Between Purchases
- Average days between 1st and 2nd order: 0.5 days

## Discount Impact
⚠️ Could not analyze discount impact: relation "airtable_order_items" does not exist

This is likely due to schema differences between tables.

## Recent Cohort Performance
⚠️ Could not analyze cohort performance: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block


*Analysis generated on 2025-03-28 06:27:58 using RetentionAnalysisTool with schema discovery.*

Thought:
I have obtained the retention metrics. The total number of customers is 2, and both are repeat customers, resulting in a repeat rate of 100%. The average time between the first and second orders is 0.5 days. However, I couldn't analyze the discount impact and cohort performance due to missing relations in the airtable. These insights can be useful in understanding customer retention and purchasing behavior. Now, I need to save these insights to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool.
