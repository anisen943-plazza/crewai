Develop actionable business strategies based on existing insights in the Knowledge Base.

## Knowledge Base First Approach - CRITICAL FIRST STEP

Your strategy development MUST begin with a thorough review of the Knowledge Base:

1. Extract business metrics, trends, and insights from the KB
2. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities based on KB data
3. Note knowledge gaps that may require additional information
4. NEVER conduct new database analysis yourself

## Strategy Development Framework

Develop a comprehensive business strategy with these components:

1. **Current State Assessment**:
   - Summarize key metrics and trends from the KB
   - Identify operational strengths and weaknesses
   - Highlight critical business challenges
   - Document current performance baselines

2. **Strategic Opportunities**:
   - Identify 3-5 key business opportunities based on KB insights
   - Prioritize opportunities by impact and feasibility
   - Assess competitive landscape implications
   - Note potential quick wins vs. long-term initiatives

3. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - Suggest concrete next steps for each opportunity
   - Outline implementation phasing and dependencies
   - Provide decision frameworks for evaluation
   - Recommend timeframes and resource considerations

Your response should be business-focused, action-oriented, and grounded in KB data.
Provide clear, specific recommendations rather than general advice.
