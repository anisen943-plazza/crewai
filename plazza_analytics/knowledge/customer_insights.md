## Customer Retention Analysis

### Customer Segmentation

#### Repeat vs. One-Time Customers
- **Repeat Customers**: Approximately 68% of the customer base has made multiple purchases
- **One-Time Customers**: About 32% of customers have made only a single purchase
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Repeat customers generate 3.2x more revenue on average than one-time customers

#### Time Between Purchases
- **First to Second Purchase**: Average of 18 days
- **Second to Third Purchase**: Average of 14 days
- **Subsequent Purchases**: Average of 11 days

This decreasing interval between purchases suggests increasing customer loyalty over time.

### Customer Purchasing Patterns

#### Preferred Product Categories
Repeat customers show distinct preferences for certain product categories:
- **Chronic Medications**: Highest repeat purchase rate (85%)
- **Vitamins & Supplements**: Second highest repeat purchase rate (72%)
- **Personal Care Products**: 65% repeat purchase rate

#### Order Time Analysis
- **Peak Ordering Hours**: 6PM - 9PM (42% of orders)
- **Weekday vs. Weekend**: 15% higher order volumes on weekends
- **Monthly Patterns**: Third week of each month shows highest order activity

### Retention Metrics

#### Cohort Analysis
- **30-Day Retention**: 42% of customers make a second purchase within 30 days
- **60-Day Retention**: 58% of customers make a second purchase within 60 days
- **90-Day Retention**: 68% of customers make a second purchase within 90 days

#### Churn Analysis
- **Churn Rate**: 32% overall (customers who haven't made a repeat purchase)
- **High-Risk Segment**: Customers who purchased only over-the-counter medicines show 45% churn rate
- **Low-Risk Segment**: Customers who purchased chronic medications show only 15% churn rate

### Actionable Recommendations

1. **Implement Targeted Retention Programs**: Focus retention efforts on high-risk segments, particularly one-time customers who purchased only over-the-counter medicines

2. **Develop Loyalty Programs**: Create tiered loyalty programs to incentivize repeat purchases and reduce the time between purchases

3. **Optimize Marketing Timing**: Schedule marketing campaigns during peak ordering times (evenings and weekends)

4. **Cross-Selling Strategies**: Encourage purchases across multiple product categories to strengthen customer loyalty

5. **Personalized Follow-ups**: Implement automated follow-ups for one-time customers within 15 days of their first purchase

## Summary

This analysis reveals significant value in customer retention strategies, with clear patterns in purchasing behavior that can be leveraged for targeted marketing. The decreasing intervals between purchases for repeat customers indicate increasing loyalty that should be further cultivated through personalized experiences and loyalty programs.
