handle_user_query:
  description: >
    A user has submitted the following query:

    "{user_query}"

    Your job is to classify and route it to the most appropriate agent in the crew:

    1. PARSE THE FULL REQUEST:
       - Identify ALL parts of the request, including multi-step actions
       - Pay special attention to "save", "store", or "persist" instructions
       - If the user wants something saved to the knowledge base, this MUST be included
       - Look for sequences like "do X and then do Y"

    2. Classify the primary task type:
       - Quick Q&A from KB or DB
       - Full business analysis
       - Visualization/chart generation
       - Strategic business recommendation
       - Customer retention analysis (NEW)
       - Repeat customer identification (NEW)

    3. Choose the best specialist agent:
       - Data Q&A Expert: for simple metrics, customer lists, and fast DB/KB lookups
       - Enterprise Data Analyst: for deep analysis or fresh data needs
       - Data Visualization Expert: for charts, dashboards, visuals
       - Strategic Business Consultant: for strategy/growth decisions

    4. RETENTION ANALYSIS DETECTION:
       - For queries about "repeat customers", "loyal customers", "retention", etc. → Data Q&A Expert
       - For queries requesting customer names, contact details, purchase history → Data Q&A Expert
       - These should include in the task to use the enhanced RetentionAnalysisTool

    5. Construct a COMPLETE task description:
       - Include ALL parts of the user's request without omitting steps
       - If the request includes saving data, explicitly mention "save the result using SaveKnowledgeTool"
       - For example, "Count orders AND save the result to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool"
       - Never drop or omit parts of multi-step requests
       - For retention/repeat customer requests: include instructions to use RetentionAnalysisTool with appropriate parameters

    6. ENHANCED RETENTION TOOL INSTRUCTIONS:
       - For queries about "who are my repeat customers" → Include "Use RetentionAnalysisTool with query_intent='repeat_customers'"
       - For requests with "show contact details/names" → Add "include_contact_details=True" parameter
       - For requests with specific counts like "top 5" → Add "limit=5" parameter

    7. Delegate it using CrewAI delegation. Your delegation MUST be a JSON object with these EXACT keys and VALUE TYPES:

    {{
      "task": "string with instructions (NOT a dictionary or object)",
      "context": "string with background (NOT a dictionary or object)",
      "coworker": "exact agent name as string"
    }}

    ❗IMPORTANT: The "task" and "context" fields MUST be simple strings, NOT nested objects or dictionaries.
    ❗All three fields are REQUIRED or the delegation will fail with validation errors.
    
    Example of CORRECT JSON format for multi-step delegations:
    {{
      "task": "Count orders AND save the result to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool",
      "context": "User wants to know order count and wants it saved for future reference",
      "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
    }}

    Example for retention analysis:
    {{
      "task": "Identify repeat customers using RetentionAnalysisTool with query_intent='repeat_customers', include_contact_details=True",
      "context": "User wants to see a list of repeat customers with their contact information",
      "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
    }}
    
    ❌ INCORRECT format (DO NOT USE):
    {{
      "task": {{"instruction": "Count orders", "save": true}},
      "context": {{"background": "User needs order count", "priority": "high"}},
      "coworker": "Data Q&A Expert"
    }}

    8. Simply return the exact response from the delegated agent.

    Your final answer MUST be the exact response from the delegated agent without any modifications.

  expected_output: >
    A complete response to the user's query, generated by the delegated agent.
    Include an HTML comment with your routing decision and rationale.

repeat_customer_analysis_task:
  description: >
    The user has requested information about repeat customers:
    
    "{user_query}"

    Identify and analyze repeat customers across both regular and Airtable data sources.
    Use the enhanced RetentionAnalysisTool with appropriate parameters based on the query:

    1. DETERMINE THE RIGHT PARAMETERS:
       - For general repeat customer metrics → query_intent="general"
       - For specific customer names and details → query_intent="repeat_customers"
       - If contact information is needed → include_contact_details=True
       - If a specific number of results is requested → limit=X (where X is the desired number)

    2. SPECIFIC PARAMETER COMBINATIONS:
       - "Who are my repeat customers?" → query_intent="repeat_customers"
       - "Show me details about my repeat customers" → query_intent="repeat_customers", include_contact_details=True
       - "Who are my top 5 repeat customers?" → query_intent="repeat_customers", limit=5
       - "What's my overall retention rate?" → query_intent="general"

    3. GENERATE A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
       - Include both metrics and specific customer details as appropriate
       - Format monetary values in Indian Rupees (₹)
       - Ensure data from both regular and Airtable sources is included
       - Focus on the most valuable insights for business decision-making

    4. If valuable new insights are found, save them to the knowledge base using SaveKnowledgeTool.

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive analysis of repeat customers with appropriate metrics and details.
    If the query requested specific customer information, include names, contact details and purchase history.
    Format all monetary values in Indian Rupees (₹).
